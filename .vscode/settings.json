// just like an fyi i added this to my settings.json that i pulled from
// stackoverflow because i wanted to automatically have the pdf output
// move to the export folder so it's a lot cleaner. can't really get around
// the img folder being duplicated though because in the tex it wants the
// same cwd and in the latexml it wants the same cwd so that requires some
// duplication for the upload ANYWAY just like for posterity be aware ya feeL?
// it breaks the auto preview if you don't change that though too. annoying.
// this whole thing is a learning exercise for me. i'm a nerd not a tech pervert
